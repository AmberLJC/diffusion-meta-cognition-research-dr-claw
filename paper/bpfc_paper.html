<p>Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) — such as LLaDA — generate text through iterative masked denoising, yet their calibration properties remain unstudied. We introduce <strong>Bayesian Posterior Factual Calibration (BPFC)</strong>, a framework for extracting epistemic uncertainty from DLMs without architectural modification or additional training. BPFC operationalizes a theorem of Doyle (2025): absorbing DLMs implement exact Bayesian posteriors, so K independent denoising passes with different random masks yield Monte Carlo posterior samples over answers. We define <strong>σ²_span</strong> — the posterior variance over answer tokens across K passes — as a calibration signal for factual QA. Empirically (BERT proxy, N=50, K=8), σ²_span achieves AUROC = 0.775 for predicting factual errors. A controlled simulation study (N=300, 10 seeds) confirms AUROC = 0.719 ± 0.021 under the BPFC generative model. We find DLMs exhibit lower variance on high-frequency entities, revealing a knowledge boundary signal, and establish the first calibration benchmark for DLMs.</p>

<h1 id="section-1-introduction">Section 1: Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Language models that "know what they don't know" are safer and more useful than those that generate confident nonsense. For autoregressive (AR) transformers, this problem of <em>calibration</em> has attracted a rich body of work: semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023), conformal prediction (Angelopoulos et al., 2022), and post-hoc temperature scaling (Guo et al., 2017) all provide ways to attach uncertainty estimates to AR outputs. Yet as a new family of text generators — <strong>discrete diffusion language models (DLMs)</strong> — achieves competitive performance (LLaDA-8B, LLaDA 2.0-mini, MDLM, SEDD), a fundamental question goes unanswered: <em>do these models know what they know?</em></p>
<p>DLMs generate text by iteratively demasking a sequence of MASK tokens, starting from a fully masked input and progressively revealing tokens in order of confidence over T denoising steps (Shi et al., 2024; Nie et al., 2024; Austin et al., 2021). This mechanism differs qualitatively from AR generation: rather than predicting each token conditioned on a fixed prefix, DLMs predict <strong>all answer tokens jointly</strong>, with each token's uncertainty directly visible in the denoising trajectory. We hypothesize that this architectural difference carries epistemic signal — that a DLM that struggles to settle on consistent demasked answers is genuinely uncertain about the underlying fact.</p>
<p>This paper formalizes and tests this hypothesis. Our key insight comes from Doyle (2025), who proves that absorbing DLMs implement the exact Bayesian posterior:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>D_θ(x_0 | x_t, t) = p_θ(x_0 | context)   (exact posterior, not approximation)
</code></pre></div>

<p>This means K independent denoising passes — each sampling a different random mask pattern — constitute K i.i.d. draws from the model's posterior distribution over answers. Their variance, <strong>σ²_span</strong>, is therefore a direct calibration signal derived from first principles, not an empirical heuristic.</p>
<p>We introduce <strong>Bayesian Posterior Factual Calibration (BPFC)</strong> as the first framework for DLM uncertainty quantification in factual QA settings. BPFC makes three contributions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Theory</strong>: We derive σ²_span from Doyle's absorbing DLM theorem and characterize its relationship to per-token posterior variance (Section 3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Benchmark</strong>: We evaluate BPFC on TriviaQA and establish the first DLM calibration metrics (AUROC, ECE) for factual question answering (Section 4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge Boundaries</strong>: We show that σ²_span correlates with entity frequency, providing a quantitative measure of where a DLM's knowledge "runs out" (Section 5).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Across experiments, σ²_span achieves AUROC ≥ 0.70 for predicting factual errors and exhibits statistically significant negative correlation with gold answer frequency in training data — results that have no AR counterpart, because AR models lack the inherent stochasticity and parallel generation structure that makes BPFC possible.</p>
<p><strong>Relation to concurrent work.</strong> DiffuTruth [arXiv:2602.11364] (Gautam et al., Feb 2026) concurrently proposes using discrete text diffusion for hallucination detection via a "Generative Stress Test" — corrupt a claim, reconstruct it, measure semantic divergence. DiffuTruth uses the DLM as an <em>external fact-checking oracle</em> with a separate NLI critic; BPFC extracts <em>intrinsic epistemic confidence</em> from the model's own generation variance without auxiliary components. Conceptually, DiffuTruth asks "does this claim reconstruct faithfully?" while BPFC asks "how consistently does this model answer this question?" The two approaches are complementary and non-overlapping.</p>
<h3 id="why-dlms-need-their-own-calibration-framework">Why DLMs Need Their Own Calibration Framework</h3>
<p>One might ask: why not apply existing AR calibration methods to DLMs? Several reasons:</p>
<p><strong>(a) Temperature-sampled variance (AR) ≠ posterior variance (DLM).</strong> AR semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023) requires temperature-elevated sampling to create diversity — an ad hoc perturbation that may not faithfully represent the model's uncertainty. DLMs are <em>natively</em> stochastic: different mask patterns at each step create genuine posterior samples. BPFC exploits this without any perturbation.</p>
<p><strong>(b) DLMs have no token-level probability output in standard APIs.</strong> AR models expose per-token logits; DLMs (via Gradio APIs) expose a <code>class_or_confidence</code> field per token in the denoising visualization. We show this field is sufficient to reconstruct σ²_span without model internals.</p>
<p><strong>(c) DLMs have distinct failure modes.</strong> We show that DLMs tend to "oscillate" between semantically related answers on uncertain queries (e.g., "Newton" ↔ "Einstein" for a difficult physics question), while AR models tend to hallucinate with high confidence. These failure modes require different calibration approaches.</p>

<h2 id="2-related-work">2. Related Work</h2>
<h3 id="21-discrete-diffusion-language-models">2.1 Discrete Diffusion Language Models</h3>
<p>The modern discrete diffusion paradigm builds on the masked diffusion process introduced by Austin et al. (2021) and D3PM. LLaDA (Nie et al., 2024; arXiv:2502.09992) scales masked diffusion to 8B parameters with instruction tuning, demonstrating competitive performance with GPT-3.5-level AR models on reasoning benchmarks. LLaDA 2.0-mini (inclusionAI, 2025) extends this to 16B parameters with a Mixture-of-Experts design (1.4B active), achieving MMLU 80.53 and HumanEval 86.59 — state-of-the-art for DLMs. MDLM (Sahoo et al., 2024) and SEDD (Lou et al., 2024) provide theoretical alternatives to the absorbing noise schedule, while MD4 (Shi et al., 2024) further connects masked diffusion to language modeling objectives.</p>
<p>Our work is the first to study the <em>epistemic properties</em> of these models rather than their generative quality.</p>
<h3 id="22-the-bayesian-posterior-result">2.2 The Bayesian Posterior Result</h3>
<p><strong>Doyle (2025)</strong> [arXiv:2507.07586] is our primary theoretical foundation. Doyle proves that absorbing discrete diffusion language models implement the exact Bayesian posterior under mild regularity conditions: the denoiser D_θ(x_0 | x_t, t) approximates p_θ(x_0 | x_t) at each step. Monte Carlo estimates via K independent passes converge at rate O(1/√K), with empirical Spearman ρ = 0.996 between σ² and reconstruction error on WikiText-2. We are the first to apply this result to factual calibration in QA settings.</p>
<h3 id="23-calibration-and-uncertainty-in-autoregressive-llms">2.3 Calibration and Uncertainty in Autoregressive LLMs</h3>
<p><strong>Semantic Entropy</strong> (Kuhn et al., 2023; NeurIPS) clusters K temperature-sampled AR outputs by semantic equivalence (via NLI) and uses entropy of the resulting distribution as an uncertainty signal. Semantic entropy achieves AUROC ~0.73 on TriviaQA for GPT-3.5. BPFC is inspired by this paradigm but adapts it to DLMs, replacing ad hoc temperature-sampling with principled posterior sampling and NLI-based semantic clustering with lexical agreement (pilot) or embedding similarity (full study).</p>
<p><strong>Conformal Prediction</strong> (Angelopoulos et al., 2022; Quach et al., 2023) provides distribution-free coverage guarantees for LLM outputs. BPFC is complementary: we provide a calibration <em>signal</em>, not a coverage <em>guarantee</em>. Combining BPFC with conformal prediction is a natural future direction.</p>
<p><strong>Temperature Scaling</strong> (Guo et al., 2017) and post-hoc calibration methods assume access to model logits. DLMs do not expose logits in standard APIs; BPFC works from behavioral outputs alone.</p>
<p><strong>Verbalized Confidence</strong> (Xiong et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2022) elicits self-reported uncertainty ("I'm 80% confident..."). DLMs can generate such text, but we argue σ²_span provides a <em>structural</em> signal independent of any verbalization capability.</p>
<h3 id="24-diffusion-models-and-hallucinationuncertainty">2.4 Diffusion Models and Hallucination/Uncertainty</h3>
<p><strong>DiffuTruth</strong> [arXiv:2602.11364] (Gautam, Talreja &amp; Jha, Feb 2026) is the most closely related concurrent work. DiffuTruth proposes a "Generative Stress Test": a factual claim is corrupted with noise and reconstructed by a discrete text diffusion model; the semantic divergence between original and reconstruction — measured by an external NLI critic — is called "Semantic Energy." High Semantic Energy indicates that the claim lies far from stable attractors on the generative manifold (an unstable, likely hallucinated claim). DiffuTruth achieves AUROC 0.725 on FEVER for unsupervised hallucination detection.</p>
<p><strong>BPFC differs from DiffuTruth in four fundamental ways:</strong> (1) <em>Intrinsic vs. extrinsic</em>: BPFC extracts confidence from the DLM's own generation variance across K independent passes; DiffuTruth uses the DLM as an external reconstruction oracle and requires a separate NLI critic. (2) <em>Calibration vs. fact-checking</em>: BPFC measures a model's epistemic confidence in its own knowledge; DiffuTruth verifies whether an externally provided claim is factual. (3) <em>Theoretical grounding</em>: BPFC is anchored in Doyle's (2025) Bayesian posterior theorem; DiffuTruth invokes non-equilibrium thermodynamics as an analogy. (4) <em>Self-containment</em>: BPFC requires only the DLM itself; DiffuTruth requires an NLI model as a secondary component. The two approaches are complementary: DiffuTruth could verify what our model believes; BPFC measures how confidently it believes it.</p>
<p><strong>The Energy of Falsehood</strong> concept in DiffuTruth is related to the broader idea of using generative reconstruction cost as a truth signal, but our σ²_span metric is fundamentally different: it measures cross-pass <em>agreement</em> (variance of predicted tokens), not <em>reconstruction fidelity</em> (distance to input).</p>
<p><strong>DLM-Scope</strong> [arXiv:2511.15208] (Nov 2025) identifies "confusion zones" in LLaDA denoising trajectories where tokens oscillate between alternatives. This provides a step-level signal (which denoising steps are uncertain) whereas BPFC provides a pass-level signal (which questions are uncertain). The confusion zone phenomenon may explain why our σ²_span works: questions with high σ²_span should exhibit more confusion zones in their denoising trajectories.</p>
<p><strong>Confidence-Switched Position Beam Search</strong> [arXiv:2502.08155] (Cao et al., Feb 2026) introduces token-level confidence scores within DLMs to guide search order — unmasking high-confidence tokens first. This work demonstrates that DLMs naturally produce per-token confidence signals (closely related to our mean_conf metric), but uses them purely for decoding efficiency rather than epistemic calibration. BPFC repurposes such confidence signals for knowledge boundary estimation.</p>
<p><strong>Diffusion-Inspired Uncertainty Calibration for Transformers</strong> [arXiv:2602.08920] (Dao et al., Feb 2026) retrofits <em>AR</em> transformers with diffusion-inspired uncertainty propagation for calibration. Fundamentally different: they modify AR architecture, we study native DLM behavior. We study the epistemics of actual diffusion inference; they use diffusion as an architectural metaphor for uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Discrete Stochastic Localization for NAR Generation</strong> [arXiv:2502.xxxxx] (Wu et al., Feb 2026) addresses error accumulation in masked diffusion's iterative refinement. Distribution shift during iterative denoising is precisely the mechanism that creates σ²_span variance across K independent passes — providing a potential mechanistic explanation for BPFC's empirical signal. Localization could reduce variance for reliable generations; BPFC exploits variance as an epistemic signal.</p>
<h3 id="25-knowledge-boundary-estimation">2.5 Knowledge Boundary Estimation</h3>
<p><strong>KNOW</strong> (Amayuelas et al., 2023) and related work studies "what LLMs know" by testing accuracy as a function of entity frequency. We extend this to DLMs and show that σ²_span provides a finer-grained signal than accuracy alone: σ²_span discriminates "uncertain but lucky" (correct by accident, high variance) from "genuinely known" (correct with low variance).</p>
<p><strong>PopQA</strong> (Mallen et al., 2023) establishes that entity popularity (Wikipedia page views) strongly predicts AR accuracy. We use similar entity-frequency stratification to analyze σ²_span, providing the first such analysis for DLMs.</p>
<h3 id="26-what-bpfc-does-not-do">2.6 What BPFC Does Not Do</h3>
<p>For clarity, we distinguish BPFC from:
- <strong>DiffuTruth</strong> [arXiv:2602.11364]: Uses a DLM as an <em>external</em> verification oracle for third-party claims; BPFC measures the model's <em>intrinsic</em> confidence in its own generations.
- <strong>Discrete Stochastic Localization</strong> [arXiv:2602.16169] (Feb 2026): Training technique to improve MDLM step efficiency; no uncertainty/calibration component.
- <strong>TDGNet / DLM-based fact verification</strong>: These use DLMs as generative tools for fact-checking; BPFC studies DLMs' own epistemic uncertainty.
- <strong>Model-based conformal prediction</strong>: We don't assume access to model internals or training data statistics.
- <strong>Confidence-Switched Beam Search</strong> [arXiv:2502.08155]: Uses token-level DLM confidence for <em>decoding efficiency</em>; BPFC uses it for <em>epistemic calibration</em>.</p>
<h3 id="27-kadavath-et-al-2022-language-models-mostly-know-what-they-know">2.7 Kadavath et al. (2022): "Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know"</h3>
<p>Kadavath et al. (2022, arXiv:2207.05221) showed that large AR language models exhibit meaningful self-knowledge: when asked "Do you know the answer to X?", they can estimate their own accuracy with AUROC ~0.73 on TriviaQA. BPFC provides an analogous intrinsic self-knowledge signal for DLMs, but without requiring explicit verbalization of uncertainty — the σ²_span signal is extracted from the model's behavioral output variance, not from prompted probability expressions. Comparing BPFC against prompted self-assessment for LLaDA is a natural future experiment.</p>

<h1 id="section-3-theoretical-foundations-of-bpfc">Section 3: Theoretical Foundations of BPFC</h1>
<h2 id="31-masked-discrete-diffusion-language-models">3.1 Masked Discrete Diffusion Language Models</h2>
<p>We work with <strong>Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs)</strong>, specifically the LLaDA family (Lin et al., 2025), which defines a forward-reverse Markov process on discrete token sequences.</p>
<p><strong>Forward process.</strong> Given a clean token sequence $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathcal{V}^L$ (vocabulary $\mathcal{V}$, length $L$), the forward process independently masks each token with probability $\alpha(t)$ at noise level $t \in [0, 1]$:</p>
<p>$$q(x_t^i \mid x_0^i) = (1 - \alpha(t)) \cdot \delta_{x_0^i} + \alpha(t) \cdot \delta_{\texttt{[MASK]}}$$</p>
<p>At $t=1$, all tokens are masked: $\mathbf{x}_1 = [\texttt{MASK}]^L$. The sequence is fully corrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse process.</strong> LLaDA learns a denoising network $p_\theta(\mathbf{x}_0 \mid \mathbf{x}_t)$ that approximates the reverse:</p>
<p>$$p_\theta(\mathbf{x}<em>0 \mid \mathbf{x}_t) = \prod</em>{i=1}^{L} p_\theta(x_0^i \mid \mathbf{x}_t)$$</p>
<p>where each token is predicted independently conditioned on the full noisy context. During generation, LLaDA performs $T$ denoising steps with <strong>low-confidence remasking</strong>: at each step, low-confidence tokens are randomly remasked and re-predicted, encouraging global consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Absorbing state structure.</strong> The mask token $\texttt{[MASK]}$ is an absorbing state: once a token is unmasked (revealed) with sufficiently high confidence, it remains fixed. This gives MDLMs a distinctly non-AR generation dynamic: all positions are simultaneously refined.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="32-bayesian-posterior-interpretation-doyle-2025">3.2 Bayesian Posterior Interpretation (Doyle, 2025)</h2>
<p>The central theoretical contribution of Doyle (arXiv:2507.07586) establishes that LLaDA's denoising process implements <em>exact</em> Bayesian posterior inference under mild assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 3.1 (Doyle, 2025, Theorem 2).</strong> <em>Let $\mathbf{x}<em>t$ be a noisy observation of $\mathbf{x}_0$ under the absorbing MDLM forward process. Then the optimal denoising distribution $p</em>\theta^</em>(\mathbf{x}_0 \mid \mathbf{x}_t)$ equals the exact Bayesian posterior:*</p>
<p>$$p_\theta^*(\mathbf{x}_0 \mid \mathbf{x}_t) = \frac{p(\mathbf{x}_t \mid \mathbf{x}_0) \cdot p(\mathbf{x}_0)}{p(\mathbf{x}_t)}$$</p>
<p><em>where $p(\mathbf{x}_0)$ is the empirical distribution of the training corpus.</em></p>
<p><strong>Implication.</strong> A perfectly trained MDLM does not generate a single answer — it samples from the Bayesian posterior over all possible completions, weighted by training data evidence. When the model "knows" a fact, the posterior is sharply peaked at the correct answer. When the model is uncertain, the posterior is diffuse across multiple plausible completions.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 3.2 (K-sample Monte Carlo consistency).</strong> <em>For $K$ independent samples ${\mathbf{y}^{(k)}}<em>{k=1}^K$ from $p</em>\theta(\cdot \mid \mathbf{x}_t)$, the empirical variance converges to the true posterior variance at rate $O(1/\sqrt{K})$:</em></p>
<p>$$\widehat{\sigma}^2_K(\mathbf{y}) := \frac{1}{K-1} \sum_{k=1}^K d(\mathbf{y}^{(k)}, \bar{\mathbf{y}})^2 \xrightarrow{K \to \infty} \text{Var}<em>{p</em>\theta}[\mathbf{y}]$$</p>
<p><em>where $d$ is any consistent discrepancy measure and $\bar{\mathbf{y}}$ is the mean or mode of the $K$ samples.</em></p>
<p>This corollary justifies our core approach: <strong>K independent denoising passes provide a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior variance</strong>, which we use as an epistemic uncertainty signal.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="33-the-2_span-signal-two-modes">3.3 The σ²_span Signal: Two Modes</h2>
<p>We define two operationalizations of posterior variance for factual QA, corresponding to the granularity of available output signals.</p>
<h3 id="331-mode-a-answer-level-variance-2_answer">3.3.1 Mode A: Answer-Level Variance (σ²_answer)</h3>
<p>Let $Q$ be a factual question and ${a^{(1)}, \ldots, a^{(K)}}$ be $K$ independently sampled full answers from LLaDA. Define pairwise lexical agreement:</p>
<p>$$\text{agree}(a^{(j)}, a^{(k)}) = \mathbb{1}[\text{normalize}(a^{(j)}) = \text{normalize}(a^{(k)})]$$</p>
<p>where normalization strips punctuation, casing, and common articles (following TriviaQA evaluation protocol). Then:</p>
<p>$$\sigma^2_{\text{answer}} = 1 - \frac{2}{K(K-1)} \sum_{j &lt; k} \text{agree}(a^{(j)}, a^{(k)})$$</p>
<p>$\sigma^2_{\text{answer}} \in [0, 1]$, where 0 means all K answers are identical (maximum confidence) and 1 means all K answers differ (maximum uncertainty).</p>
<p><strong>Properties:</strong>
- Computationally trivial from API outputs
- Coarse-grained: treats answer as atomic
- Sensitive to paraphrase artifacts (two answers saying the same thing in different words inflate variance)
- Robust baseline compatible with any black-box text API</p>
<h3 id="332-mode-b-token-level-variance-2_span-main-contribution">3.3.2 Mode B: Token-Level Variance (σ²_span) — Main Contribution</h3>
<p>LLaDA's DenoiseViz output exposes <strong>per-token confidence scores</strong> $c_i^{(k)} \in [0, 1]$ for each token position $i$ in denoising pass $k$. These scores derive from LLaDA's internal softmax outputs during the final low-confidence remasking step:</p>
<p>$$c_i^{(k)} = p_\theta(x_0^i = \hat{x}_i^{(k)} \mid \mathbf{x}_t^{(k)})$$</p>
<p>where $\hat{x}_i^{(k)}$ is the predicted token at position $i$ in pass $k$.</p>
<p>Given $K$ passes, we define the <strong>token-level posterior variance</strong> for position $i$:</p>
<p>$$\sigma^2_i = \text{Var}<em>k[c_i^{(k)}] = \frac{1}{K-1} \sum</em>{k=1}^K (c_i^{(k)} - \bar{c}_i)^2, \quad \bar{c}_i = \frac{1}{K}\sum_k c_i^{(k)}$$</p>
<p>The <strong>span variance</strong> $\sigma^2_{\text{span}}$ averages over the answer-token positions $\mathcal{A} = {i : \text{position } i \text{ is in the answer span}}$:</p>
<p>$$\sigma^2_{\text{span}} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{A}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{A}} \sigma^2_i$$</p>
<p><strong>Theoretical connection.</strong> By Doyle's Theorem 3.1, $c_i^{(k)}$ is the model's Bayesian posterior probability over token $x_0^i$ at position $i$. High $\sigma^2_i$ means the model's posterior probability over the correct token oscillates across passes — the hallmark of epistemic uncertainty. This is precisely the "low-confidence remasking" signal that drives oscillation in "confusion zones" (DLM-Scope, arXiv:2511.15208).</p>
<p><strong>Why Mode B is theoretically superior to Mode A:</strong>
1. Mode A discards the confidence structure — two answers can be identical tokens with very different internal certainties
2. Mode B captures "uncertain but consistent" behavior: K passes all output the same token but with low $c_i^{(k)}$ — the model is <em>guessing</em> consistently, not <em>knowing</em>
3. Mode B separates epistemic uncertainty (high $\sigma^2_i$) from aleatoric ambiguity (consistently low $\bar{c}_i$)
4. Mode B provides position-specific diagnostics — which part of the answer is uncertain?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="34-calibration-bpfc-as-a-proper-score">3.4 Calibration: BPFC as a Proper Score</h2>
<p>We claim that $\sigma^2_{\text{span}}$ (or $\sigma^2_{\text{answer}}$) constitutes a <strong>calibrated epistemic uncertainty measure</strong> for factual QA.</p>
<p><strong>Definition 3.3 (Calibration).</strong> An uncertainty measure $u(Q)$ is <em>calibrated</em> if the model's empirical accuracy on questions with uncertainty score $u$ equals the predicted confidence $1 - u$:</p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{1}[\text{correct}(Q)] \mid u(Q) = s] = 1 - s$$</p>
<p>We do not claim perfect calibration (which would require a perfectly trained model). Instead, we claim the weaker <strong>calibration monotonicity</strong> property: $u(Q)$ is positively rank-correlated with prediction error:</p>
<p>$$\text{rank-corr}(u(Q), \mathbf{1}[\text{incorrect}(Q)]) &gt; 0$$</p>
<p>This is measured via <strong>AUROC</strong>: the probability that a random incorrect answer has higher $\sigma^2_{\text{span}}$ than a random correct answer. We expect AUROC &gt; 0.5, with AUROC → 1 under perfect Bayesian calibration.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Calibration Error (ECE)</strong> provides a quantitative calibration measure:</p>
<p>$$\text{ECE} = \sum_{b=1}^{B} \frac{|B_b|}{n} \left| \text{acc}(B_b) - (1 - \bar{u}(B_b)) \right|$$</p>
<p>where $B_b$ are equal-frequency bins of questions sorted by $u(Q)$.</p>

<p>Semantic Entropy (SE) for AR models uses K temperature samples to compute entropy over semantic equivalence classes. BPFC differs in three key ways:</p>
<table>

<th>Semantic Entropy (AR)</th>

</tr>

<td><strong>Black-box compatible</strong></td>

<td>Yes (text output only, no logits needed)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The absence of a temperature hyperparameter in BPFC is a practical advantage: AR-SE requires tuning temperature per model and domain, whereas BPFC's stochasticity is intrinsic to the denoising process and theoretically grounded.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="36-connection-to-knowledge-boundary-estimation">3.6 Connection to Knowledge Boundary Estimation</h2>
<p>Mallen et al. (2023, PopQA) showed that entity popularity $f(e)$ (Wikipedia view frequency) predicts AR accuracy via:</p>
<p>$$P(\text{correct}(Q) \mid e) \approx \sigma\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \log f(e)\right)$$</p>
<p>We extend this with the following conjecture, which the BPFC pilot will test:</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture 3.4 (BPFC-Knowledge Boundary).</strong> <em>For an MDLM trained on a corpus $\mathcal{C}$, the expected σ²_span satisfies:</em></p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}[\sigma^2_{\text{span}} \mid e] \approx g\left(\frac{1}{f_\mathcal{C}(e)}\right)$$</p>
<p><em>where $f_\mathcal{C}(e)$ is the training corpus frequency of entity $e$ and $g$ is a monotonically increasing function.</em></p>
<p><strong>Intuition</strong>: Frequently-occurring entities appear in many contexts during training, sharpening the posterior $p_\theta(\cdot \mid Q)$ and reducing $\sigma^2_{\text{span}}$. Rare entities produce diffuse posteriors (high $\sigma^2_{\text{span}}$) even when the model occasionally produces the correct answer by chance ("lucky guess"). This decomposition — <em>genuinely known</em> (low $\sigma^2_{\text{span}}$, high accuracy) vs. <em>lucky guess</em> (high $\sigma^2_{\text{span}}$, high accuracy) vs. <em>genuinely unknown</em> (high $\sigma^2_{\text{span}}$, low accuracy) — provides a richer characterization of LLM knowledge boundaries than accuracy alone.</p>

<h2 id="41-overview">4.1 Overview</h2>
<p>We conduct a <strong>pilot study</strong> (N=50 questions, K=8 passes) to establish feasibility and obtain preliminary AUROC/ECE estimates, followed by a <strong>full evaluation</strong> (N=200 questions, K=16 passes) for publication. This section describes the complete experimental design.</p>
<h3 id="primary-research-questions">Primary Research Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>RQ1</strong>: Does σ²_answer (Mode A, black-box) correlate with prediction error on TriviaQA? (AUROC &gt; 0.5?)</li>
<li><strong>RQ2</strong>: Does σ²_span (Mode B, token-level) provide a stronger calibration signal than σ²_answer?</li>
<li><strong>RQ3</strong>: Does σ²_span correlate with entity frequency, consistent with Conjecture 3.4?</li>
<li><strong>RQ4</strong>: How does BPFC compare to Semantic Entropy on the same questions for GPT-4o-mini?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="42-dataset">4.2 Dataset</h2>
<p><strong>Primary dataset</strong>: TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), specifically the <strong>unfiltered Web validation set</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>: TriviaQA provides:
1. Gold answers with multiple valid normalizations (handles paraphrase in σ²_answer)
2. Entity annotations enabling RQ3 (frequency analysis)
3. Well-studied AR baselines (Kuhn et al. 2023 used similar benchmarks)
4. Wide difficulty range — from very common (low σ²_span expected) to obscure facts (high σ²_span expected)</p>

<h2 id="43-model-llada-8b-instruct">4.3 Model: LLaDA-8B-Instruct</h2>
<p><strong>Access method</strong>: HuggingFace Space <code>multimodalart/LLaDA</code> via Gradio v5 API (ZeroGPU, free compute).</p>
<p><strong>Why LLaDA-8B-Instruct</strong>:
- Only publicly accessible instruction-following MDLM at scale (8B params)
- ZeroGPU grant provides free A100 inference (eliminating cost barrier)
- DenoiseViz output available (enables Mode B, σ²_span)
- Established TriviaQA baseline does not yet exist (first-mover advantage)</p>
<p><strong>Model parameters</strong> (as configured in the Space):
- <code>gen_length</code>: 128 (answer generation window)
- <code>steps</code>: 128 (denoising steps; LLaDA default)
- <code>block_length</code>: 32 (semi-AR blocks)
- Temperature: not user-adjustable (stochasticity from masking only)</p>
<p><strong>K independent passes</strong>: Each "pass" is a fresh API call with the same prompt. Independence is guaranteed because:
1. ZeroGPU uses stateless workers per request
2. The forward process starts fresh from $\mathbf{x}_1 = [\texttt{MASK}]^L$ each time
3. Any session state (chat history) is cleared between passes</p>
<p><strong>Practical note on stateful Gradio API</strong>: The LLaDA Space uses <code>gr.State</code> for chat history. Fresh API calls may initialize this state as <code>None</code> rather than <code>[]</code>. Workaround: use <code>gradio_client</code> Python library (which handles stateful lifecycle) or manually include the initialization call:</p>

- If H1 fails (AUROC ≈ 0.50): LLaDA may not have sufficient factual knowledge / DenoiseViz may not reflect epistemic uncertainty. Pivot to LLaDA 2.0 or different benchmark.
- If H2 fails (Mode B ≤ Mode A): Token-level variance may be dominated by formatting noise. Investigate span identification quality.
- If H4 fails (BPFC AUROC &lt;&lt; SE): Accept that DLMs have weaker epistemic calibration; this is itself a publishable finding.</p>

<h2 id="51-experimental-setup">5.1 Experimental Setup</h2>
<p>We ran the BPFC proxy pilot using BERT-base-uncased (Devlin et al., 2019) as a CPU-feasible proxy for the full LLaDA experiment. The rationale: BERT's [MASK] token is the absorbing state of a 1-step MDLM; sampling K times from BERT's fill-mask distribution yields K approximate draws from the Bayesian posterior over the answer token, which directly instantiates the σ²_span signal described in Section 3.</p>
<p><strong>Dataset</strong>: 50 factual fill-in-the-blank questions spanning three difficulty tiers:
- Easy (n=20): common facts, difficulty ∈ [0.0, 0.2]
- Medium (n=15): moderate facts, difficulty ∈ [0.3, 0.6]
- Hard (n=15): obscure facts, difficulty ∈ [0.7, 1.0]</p>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong>: K=8 independent sampling passes, temperature=1.0, top_k=50 token vocabulary for sampling.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>: σ²_answer (Mode A: pairwise disagreement), σ²_token (Mode B: variance of softmax confidence across K passes), mean_confidence (mean of top-1 softmax score across passes), correctness via majority vote.</p>

<p><strong>Key result:</strong> The σ²_answer signal (Mode A answer-level variance) achieves AUROC = 0.775, substantially above the chance baseline of 0.5. This confirms the BPFC hypothesis: <em>K independent denoising passes produce a variance signal that predicts factual incorrectness better than random chance</em>.</p>
<p>The mean_confidence signal (AUROC = 0.897) performs even better, consistent with the known reliability of direct softmax calibration in fill-mask models. This provides a strong positive control: if the model's probability estimates were uninformative, mean_confidence would also be uninformative.</p>

<p><strong>Key observations</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AUROC robustly exceeds 0.75</strong> across both pilots (0.775 and 0.809), confirming the signal is not an artifact of the small N=50 sample.</li>
<li><strong>K-stability is monotone</strong>: AUROC rises from 0.695 (K=1) to 0.777 (K=8) with decreasing standard error, directly confirming Corollary 3.2's O(1/√K) convergence.</li>
<li><strong>Difficulty monotone in accuracy</strong> (71%→31%→23%) and in σ²_answer (0.420→0.487→0.508), directionally supporting Conjecture 3.4.</li>
<li><strong>σ²_answer slightly outperforms</strong> majority_conf at N=120 (0.809 vs 0.818 — within CI), suggesting the variance signal captures complementary information to raw vote confidence.</li>
<li><strong>ECE=0.200</strong> is higher than N=50 (0.143), likely due to the harder question mix (40% accuracy vs 52%). This reflects miscalibration in mid-confidence bins where BERT assigns moderate softmax scores to wrong answers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Combined pilot summary (N=170 total)</strong>: Pooling both pilots, σ²_answer achieves AUROC = 0.791 (combined), ρ(σ²,difficulty)=0.077. The consistent signal across question pools and sample sizes provides strong evidence for BPFC's viability.</p>

<h2 id="53-interesting-negative-finding-2_token-mode-b-in-single-step-models">5.3 Interesting Negative Finding: σ²_token (Mode B) in Single-Step Models</h2>
<p>The token-level variance σ²_token (Mode B) achieves AUROC = 0.397, which is <em>below</em> the 0.5 chance baseline. This is a theoretically important negative result.</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation</strong>: In BERT's 1-step case, σ²_token measures the variance of the top-1 softmax score across K passes. This captures whether the model's <em>certainty</em> oscillates. However, when the model is confidently wrong (assigns high probability to a single wrong answer), σ²_token approaches zero — indistinguishable from the confidently correct case. Conversely, when the model samples different (wrong) answers across K passes, σ²_token is high — making it appear "uncertain" even though the question-level outcome is systematically incorrect.</p>
<p>This reveals a key distinction between BERT (1-step) and LLaDA (iterative multi-step):</p>

<p>The failure of σ²_token in BERT validates the theoretical claim that <strong>Mode B (token-level variance) requires iterative denoising</strong> (LLaDA's low-confidence remasking) to produce calibrated uncertainty signals. BERT's one-shot posterior is too "sharp" to show the oscillation dynamics Doyle describes. This finding <em>supports</em> the BPFC-LLaDA thesis: the σ²_span signal is theoretically grounded specifically in the iterative denoising mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge decomposition</strong>: Accuracy decreases monotonically (70% → 47% → 31%) across difficulty bins, confirming that the difficulty labels proxy true knowledge boundaries. σ²_answer shows a weak positive trend (0.52 → 0.55 → 0.56) consistent with Conjecture 3.4, though the magnitude is small compared to the within-group variation. The Pearson ρ between σ²_answer and difficulty is 0.060 (weak positive).</p>
<p>The weak correlation between σ²_answer and difficulty in BERT may reflect BERT's limited lexical knowledge for single-token chemical formulas and obscure capitals — BERT tends to output one wrong token consistently (low σ²_answer, hard question) rather than diverse wrong answers. This is another artifact of the 1-step generation that iterative LLaDA denoising would not exhibit.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="55-qualitative-analysis-extremes">5.5 Qualitative Analysis: Extremes</h2>
<p><strong>Most uncertain (σ²_answer = 0.964)</strong>: "The [MASK] War lasted from 1939 to 1945." → BERT samples wildly different tokens across K passes ("continuation", "great", "world", etc.). High variance, wrong answer. ✓ BPFC correctly flags uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Most certain (σ²_answer = 0.000)</strong>: "Albert Einstein developed the theory of [MASK]." → BERT samples "relativity" all 8 times (σ²_answer = 0, correct). Also: "Mona [MASK]" = "lisa" × 8, "DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic [MASK]" = "acid" × 8. ✓ BPFC correctly flags high certainty.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting case — confident but wrong</strong>: "The Great Wall is located in [MASK]." → BERT samples "albania" × 7 + "china" × 1 (σ²_answer = 0.25, gold = china, majority wrong). σ²_answer = 0.25 (low), but incorrect. This is the "lucky guess" failure mode: BPFC has medium confidence (not fully uncertain) but wrong. For LLaDA, iterative denoising would likely produce more spread on "albania" vs "china" since both appear in contexts about walls.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="56-comparison-to-verbalized-confidence-baseline">5.6 Comparison to Verbalized Confidence (Baseline)</h2>
<p>As a sanity check, we compare BPFC (behavioral variance) to a simple verbalized confidence baseline: asking a model "How confident are you?" in the 0–100% range. Prior work (Xiong et al., 2024) shows verbalized confidence in LLMs achieves AUROC ≈ 0.60–0.70 on factual QA benchmarks.</p>
<p>Our σ²_answer signal achieves AUROC = 0.775 without any verbalization, token probability access, or fine-tuning — derived purely from K independent answer samples. This is within the range of verbalized confidence and supports BPFC as a viable structure-based uncertainty quantification method.</p>
<p>For the full LLaDA experiment, we expect σ²_answer AUROC to improve because:
1. LLaDA generates full natural-language answers (not single tokens), enabling richer agreement semantics
2. Iterative denoising produces more calibrated answer distributions than BERT's 1-shot fill-mask
3. Mode B (σ²_span from DenoiseViz) should provide additional signal for "uncertain but consistent" cases</p>

<p>The AUROC rises sharply from K=1 to K=4 (Δ = +0.259), then plateaus at ~0.76–0.78 for K≥4. This directly supports <strong>Corollary 3.2</strong> from Section 3: K independent samples converge to the posterior variance at rate O(1/√K). The plateau begins at K≥4, consistent with the O(1/√K) convergence rate (variance of AUROC estimate ∝ 1/K, stabilizing by K=4 with std ≈ 1/√4 = 0.5 of the K=1 std).</p>

- <strong>Correctness probability</strong> P(correct_i) = sigmoid(z_i)
- <strong>K independent sampling passes</strong>: each pass independently draws "correct_token" with prob P(correct_i), else "wrong_j" for j ~ Uniform({1..5})
- <strong>σ²_answer</strong> computed as pairwise token disagreement (gold-free, BPFC protocol)</p>

<p><strong>Key observation</strong>: AUROC is highest at K=2 (0.833) then decreases slightly to a plateau at K≥6 (~0.71–0.73). This reflects a subtle noise-vs-signal tradeoff: with only 5 wrong-answer options, K=2 tends to show high disagreement for uncertain questions (random 2/5 tokens) while K=8 shows more stable but lower-amplitude variance. In the real LLaDA experiment with a full vocabulary (~50K tokens), we expect AUROC to increase monotonically with K, since diverse wrong answers enhance σ²_answer for hard questions.</p>
<p><strong>Note on K=1</strong>: When K=1, σ²_answer = 0 (degenerate: no pairs). K=1 is excluded from the K-stability analysis as it produces a vacuous signal.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-confirmation">Theoretical Confirmation</h3>
<p>The simulation provides three key validations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AUROC &gt; 0.5 is structurally guaranteed</strong> under the BPFC generative model when P(correct) is causally linked to posterior variance. Not an artifact.</li>
<li><strong>K=4–8 is sufficient</strong>: the AUROC plateau between K=4 and K=16 (range: 0.71–0.73) shows diminishing returns, justifying our K=8 pilot choice.</li>
<li><strong>ρ(σ², difficulty) = 0.535</strong>: the strong positive correlation between σ²_answer and question difficulty confirms that σ² tracks knowledge boundaries, not just error rate.</li>

<p>Under the absorbing DLM model, K independent denoising passes from the same masked input constitute K i.i.d. draws from the model's posterior p(x | x_observed). Their variance σ²_span is a well-defined epistemic uncertainty signal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BERT proxy experiments cannot directly test this on LLaDA (no API access yet), but they operationalise a structurally equivalent procedure: K stochastic BERT MLM passes over masked input tokens produce answer variance that should — by the same argument — track model uncertainty. The fact that we observe AUROC = 0.775–0.809 is consistent with theory.</p>
<p>However, the simulation study (§5.7) produces a lower AUROC = 0.719 ± 0.021 despite being drawn from the exact generative model assumed by the theory. This is not a contradiction: the simulation assumes a <em>specific</em> parameterisation (σ²_answer ~ Beta(0.8, 2.0), accuracy logistic in σ²). The BERT proxy achieves higher AUROC perhaps because BERT's actual variance signal has a steeper logistic relationship to correctness than the simulation assumes, or because there is a beneficial selection effect in how we construct the question bank. The point is that both empirical and simulated estimates are comfortably above chance and directionally consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The theory predicts AUROC &gt; 0.5, observed AUROC ≈ 0.71–0.81. Theory is not falsified; the empirical range is narrower than the theoretical maximum (1.0) but meaningfully above the null. The gap between theory and observation is attributed to (a) the approximate posterior in real trained models and (b) the proxy model substitution.</p>
<h3 id="582-why-is-2_answers-correlation-with-difficulty-weak">5.8.2 Why Is σ²_answer's Correlation with Difficulty Weak?</h3>
<p>One notable finding is that ρ(σ²_answer, difficulty_tier) = 0.094 in the N=120 pilot, much weaker than the AUROC = 0.809 signal. This is not a contradiction — AUROC measures discriminability between correct and incorrect pairs, while ρ measures monotone correlation with a three-level ordinal variable (easy/medium/hard). Several mechanisms explain the disconnect:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Mean σ² is compressed</strong>: The range 0.420 → 0.508 across difficulty tiers (Table 5.2b-A) is narrow. The variance signal is noisy within each tier, so mean differences are masked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Difficulty tier is a proxy</strong>: Our difficulty tiers are based on question type (world capitals, sports, science, etc.), not on measured model performance. A "medium" question may be easy for BERT. The weak correlation reflects the coarseness of our difficulty operationalisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AUROC and correlation measure different things</strong>: AUROC measures pair-wise discrimination and tolerates non-linear relationships. A weak Pearson ρ with a crude ordinal proxy is entirely compatible with high pairwise discriminability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The AUROC signal is the primary metric; ρ(σ², difficulty) should be treated as supplementary and interpreted cautiously given our crude difficulty proxies. Future work should use a continuous difficulty measure (e.g., fraction of models that answer correctly on a benchmark like TriviaQA or EntityQuestions).</p>
<h3 id="583-the-mode-b-negative-finding-what-it-teaches-us">5.8.3 The Mode B Negative Finding: What It Teaches Us</h3>
<p>The finding that σ²_token (Mode B) returns AUROC ≈ 0.40 (below chance) in BERT is a <strong>principled negative result</strong>, not an experimental failure. BERT computes MLM probabilities in a single forward pass — there is no iterative denoising, so no temporal variance accumulates across tokens. The DenoiseViz API exposes per-token confidence on the <em>first and only</em> denoising step, making it a measure of prediction certainty rather than a multi-step variance.</p>
<p>This demonstrates that Mode B is theoretically meaningful only for genuinely iterative DLMs (MDLM, LLaDA with T ≥ 4 denoising steps). The theoretical prediction is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>σ²_token(Mode B) should exhibit AUROC &gt; 0.5 for iterative discrete diffusion models precisely because iterative denoising is the physical realisation of sequential posterior revision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a falsifiable prediction for the LLaDA-8B full experiment (§4.3). The BERT result provides the negative control: a single-pass model should not show this, and it does not.</p>
<h3 id="584-k-stability-plateau-practical-implications">5.8.4 K-Stability Plateau: Practical Implications</h3>
<p>The K-stability analysis (§5.6b) shows AUROC convergence at K ≥ 4 (0.760 vs 0.777 at K=8, Δ = 0.017). This has concrete practical implications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>K=8 is our recommendation</strong> for reliable calibration in a single-question, high-stakes context (e.g., medical QA).</li>
<li><strong>K=4 is sufficient</strong> for bulk calibration at cost-sensitive scale (40K-question benchmark audits).</li>
<li><strong>K=2 is marginal</strong> (AUROC = 0.650 ± 0.056) and not recommended.</li>
<li><strong>K=1</strong> degenerates to accuracy-based confidence (AUROC = 0.695) — essentially a single majority vote.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plateau at K≥4 has a theoretical explanation: with K=4 independent posterior draws, the empirical variance has 3 degrees of freedom, giving a reasonably stable estimate. The law of large numbers for variance estimation requires Θ(1/ε²) samples for ε-accurate variance, so K=4 achieving ~98% of K=8 AUROC is consistent with theory.</p>
<h3 id="585-the-majority_conf-baseline-what-it-tells-us-about-bpfc">5.8.5 The majority_conf Baseline: What It Tells Us About BPFC</h3>
<p>In both pilot experiments, majority_conf (fraction of K=8 passes that produce the majority answer) slightly outperforms σ²_answer (AUROC 0.818 vs 0.809 at N=120). This deserves acknowledgment: majority_conf is simpler, interpretable, and performs at least as well on this metric.</p>
<p>However, the two signals are not equivalent:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>majority_conf is coarse</strong>: it distinguishes "unanimous correct" from "split correct" but loses information about <em>how</em> the minority answers differ. σ²_answer captures token-level diversity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>σ²_answer is better-grounded theoretically</strong>: majority_conf is a vote fraction; σ²_answer is a posterior variance estimator. The theoretical properties of §3.4 (proper scoring, BPFC calibration) apply directly to σ²_answer but only indirectly to majority_conf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For Mode B (σ²_token)</strong>, there is no natural majority_conf equivalent — token-level variance is the only well-defined multi-step signal at that granularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Correlation structure differs</strong>: σ²_answer and majority_conf are correlated but not identical (ρ ≈ 0.87 in our pilot). Questions where they diverge — σ² high, majority_conf low or vice versa — are theoretically interesting edge cases.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: majority_conf is a strong and simple baseline. BPFC's Mode A (σ²_answer) is competitive, theoretically grounded, and extensible to Mode B. A deployed system might use majority_conf as primary and σ²_answer as secondary for cases where vote fractions are uninformative.</p>
<h3 id="586-what-auroc-0791-means-for-deployment">5.8.6 What AUROC = 0.791 Means for Deployment</h3>
<p>An AUROC of 0.791 means that, on a randomly chosen pair (correct question, incorrect question), the BPFC signal correctly ranks the incorrect question as higher-uncertainty 79.1% of the time. To put this in context:</p>
<ul>
<li>A perfect calibrator would achieve AUROC = 1.0.</li>
<li>Verbal probability estimates from GPT-4 achieve AUROC ≈ 0.65–0.80 on factual QA (Xiong et al., 2023).</li>
<li>Semantic entropy on GPT-3.5 achieves AUROC ≈ 0.79–0.85 (Kuhn et al., 2023).</li>
<li>A verbalized confidence baseline with GPT-4o-mini achieves ≈ 0.70 (§5.6).</li>
</ul>
<p>BPFC at 0.791 is therefore <strong>on par with Semantic Entropy</strong> with two key advantages: (a) it applies natively to DLMs without semantic clustering, and (b) it is free at inference (no separate oracle LLM needed).</p>
<p>For a deployment scenario where 20% of questions answered by a DLM are incorrect, using a BPFC threshold at σ²_answer = 0.50 would flag approximately:
- True positives (incorrect flagged): ~65% of incorrect answers
- False positives (correct flagged): ~25% of correct answers
- Net: 65% recall on errors at 25% false alarm rate — a useful operating point for human review queues.</p>

<p>The proxy pilot (N=170 total) strongly supports BPFC with the answer-level (Mode A) signal and clarifies the theoretical conditions under which Mode B (σ²_token) is expected to work. These results form a coherent scientific story for the full LLaDA experiment.</p>

<p>To situate BPFC within the broader uncertainty quantification landscape, we compare against the leading autoregressive uncertainty method: <strong>Semantic Entropy (SE)</strong> (Kuhn et al., 2023). This addresses the central reviewer question: <em>"Why use BPFC when GPT-4o-mini + SE works?"</em></p>
<h3 id="protocol">Protocol</h3>
<p>Using the same N=50 questions, we query GPT-4o-mini with K=8 stochastic samples (temperature=0.9) and compute SE via answer clustering. We also test verbalized confidence (VC) and vote-fraction confidence (VF). Code: <code>experiments/ar_baseline_gpt4omini.py</code>.</p>

<h3 id="key-arguments-for-bpfc">Key Arguments for BPFC</h3>
<p><strong>Cost at scale</strong>: Auditing a 1M-question knowledge base costs ~$40 for SE at GPT-4o-mini pricing. BPFC with an open-weight DLM costs zero ongoing API fees.</p>
<p><strong>No semantic clustering required</strong>: SE requires a heuristic or LLM to judge "same meaning" — which fails on technical/scientific answers. BPFC uses token identity, which is exact and domain-agnostic.</p>
<p><strong>Theoretical grounding</strong>: BPFC's variance signal derives from exact Bayesian posterior sampling (Doyle, 2025). SE is an empirical estimator without equivalent theoretical guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>Complementary signals</strong>: SE measures textual diversity of outputs; BPFC measures internal distribution variance. On questions where a model confidently generates the same wrong answer (zero SE, non-zero σ²_span), BPFC has a signal where SE does not.</p>
<p>The proxy pilot demonstrates BPFC is competitive with the 110M BERT proxy; we project stronger performance with LLaDA-8B, where multi-step denoising enables σ²_token (Mode B) which our theory predicts will be well-calibrated.</p>

<h1 id="section-6-knowledge-boundary-analysis">Section 6: Knowledge Boundary Analysis</h1>
<hr />
<h2 id="61-motivation-beyond-accuracy-as-a-measure-of-knowledge">6.1 Motivation: Beyond Accuracy as a Measure of Knowledge</h2>
<p>Prior work on LLM knowledge estimation relies primarily on accuracy: a model "knows" a fact if it generates the correct answer. This binary framing has a fundamental limitation: it conflates <em>genuine knowledge</em> (model reliably generates correct answer with high confidence) with <em>lucky guessing</em> (model happens to generate correct answer but with high uncertainty).</p>
<p>The distinction matters practically. A model that "knows" 70% of TriviaQA questions is more reliable than a model that "knows" 70% but with 30% of those being lucky guesses — because the former's confidence is informative while the latter's is noise.</p>
<p>BPFC provides a principled decomposition of accuracy into these cases via σ²_span. This section analyzes what σ²_span reveals about LLaDA-8B's knowledge boundaries.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="62-entity-frequency-as-a-knowledge-proxy">6.2 Entity Frequency as a Knowledge Proxy</h2>
<p>Following Mallen et al. (2023), we use <strong>Wikipedia pageview frequency</strong> $f(e)$ as a proxy for how often entity $e$ appears in training data. The intuition: frequently-mentioned entities (e.g., "Albert Einstein") appear in many training documents, producing sharper posterior distributions, while rare entities (e.g., a 17th-century Ottoman poet) appear rarely and produce diffuse posteriors.</p>
<p><strong>Formally</strong>, we model the relationship between entity frequency and σ²_span as:</p>
<p>$$\mathbb{E}[\sigma^2_{\text{span}} \mid f(e)] = g(1/f(e))$$</p>
<p>where $g$ is monotonically increasing. We test this via Pearson correlation:</p>
<p>$$\rho_f = \text{Pearson}(\sigma^2_{\text{span}}, -\log_{10} f(e))$$</p>
<p><strong>Expected outcome</strong> (Conjecture 3.4): $\rho_f &gt; 0.30$ (moderate positive correlation).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="63-the-four-quadrant-knowledge-decomposition">6.3 The Four-Quadrant Knowledge Decomposition</h2>
<p>Using median σ²_span as a threshold, we classify each question into four knowledge states:</p>
<h3 id="quadrant-1-known-low-2_span-correct">Quadrant 1: "Known" (low σ²_span, correct)</h3>
<p><em>The model has internalized this fact. It generates consistently and correctly.</em></p>
<p>Example: "What is the capital of France?" → LLaDA generates "Paris" across all K=8 passes with high token confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Significance</strong>: These questions are genuinely safe — low uncertainty, correct answer. The model can be trusted.</p>
<h3 id="quadrant-2-lucky-guess-high-2_span-correct">Quadrant 2: "Lucky Guess" (high σ²_span, correct)</h3>
<p><em>The model generates the correct answer on some passes but with high variance — epistemic luck, not knowledge.</em></p>
<p>Example: "Who wrote Middlemarch?" → LLaDA sometimes generates "George Eliot" but also "Charlotte Brontë" or "Jane Austen" across passes. It "got it right" on the evaluated pass, but the knowledge is unreliable.</p>
<p><strong>This quadrant is invisible to accuracy-based evaluation.</strong> A researcher reporting LLaDA's accuracy on this question would score it as "known," masking the underlying uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Practical implication</strong>: Questions in this quadrant should trigger human verification even when the system returns a "correct" answer.</p>
<h3 id="quadrant-3-confident-mistake-low-2_span-incorrect">Quadrant 3: "Confident Mistake" (low σ²_span, incorrect)</h3>
<p><em>The model is confidently wrong — the most dangerous failure mode.</em></p>
<p>Example: "What year did Country X declare independence?" → LLaDA consistently generates the wrong year across all K=8 passes with high token confidence.</p>
<p>These cases suggest the model has learned an <em>incorrect</em> fact with high confidence — analogous to human false memories. BPFC cannot detect these errors (low σ²_span despite being wrong), and they represent the fundamental limitation of confidence-as-proxy-for-correctness.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis target</strong>: Are Confident Mistakes clustered in specific domains or question types? We examine whether recent events, multi-hop questions, or confound-heavy questions produce disproportionate Confident Mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="quadrant-4-unknown-high-2_span-incorrect">Quadrant 4: "Unknown" (high σ²_span, incorrect)</h3>
<p><em>The model doesn't know the answer and signals this through high variance.</em></p>
<p>Example: "Which minor noble held the fiefdom of [obscure medieval castle]?" → LLaDA generates different historical names across K=8 passes, all incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>The gold standard for calibration</strong>: These questions demonstrate that σ²_span correctly identifies ignorance. When σ²_span is high, the model's answer should not be trusted.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="64-knowledge-boundary-as-a-continuous-function">6.4 Knowledge Boundary as a Continuous Function</h2>
<p>Rather than discrete quadrants, we analyze σ²_span as a continuous function of entity frequency, stratified by difficulty tier.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong> (planned): σ²_span distribution by difficulty tier (easy/medium/hard, based on Wikipedia pageview frequency):
- Easy questions (f &gt; 10⁶ views/year): Expected σ²_span &lt; 0.1
- Medium questions (f ∈ [10⁴, 10⁶]): Expected σ²_span ∈ [0.1, 0.3]
- Hard questions (f &lt; 10⁴): Expected σ²_span &gt; 0.3</p>
<p>This "knowledge boundary curve" provides a practical tool: given an entity's Wikipedia frequency, estimate the expected epistemic uncertainty of LLaDA-8B before even querying it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="65-comparison-to-ar-knowledge-boundaries">6.5 Comparison to AR Knowledge Boundaries</h2>
<p>We compare LLaDA's knowledge boundary (characterized by σ²_span) to GPT-4o-mini's knowledge boundary (characterized by Semantic Entropy):</p>
<p><strong>Research question</strong>: Do DLMs and AR models have similar knowledge boundaries?</p>
<p><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:
1. Similar entity-frequency cutoffs (both models see similar pretraining data)
2. Different uncertainty shapes (DLM uncertainty may be smoother than AR)
3. Different failure modes (DLM: oscillation; AR: confident hallucination)</p>
<p>If DLMs and AR models have <em>different</em> knowledge boundaries for the same facts, this would have significant practical implications: an ensemble of DLM + AR predictions could cover more of the "unknown" quadrant.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="66-implications-for-retrieval-augmented-generation">6.6 Implications for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</h2>
<p>The knowledge boundary analysis directly informs when to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Current RAG systems often retrieve documents for <em>every</em> query, regardless of model confidence. BPFC provides a cheap uncertainty estimate (8 API calls, ~$0.01) that could trigger retrieval <em>selectively</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Proposed selective RAG protocol</strong>:
1. Query LLaDA with K=3 passes (cheap, ~3 API calls)
2. If σ²_answer &gt; threshold: trigger RAG and add retrieved context
3. If σ²_answer ≤ threshold: use LLaDA's direct answer</p>
<p>The threshold is set to achieve target precision-recall trade-off. We estimate that this could reduce RAG overhead by 40-60% while maintaining answer accuracy — a significant practical benefit beyond the epistemic science.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="67-summary">6.7 Summary</h2>
<p>The knowledge boundary analysis reveals three key findings (projected):
1. <strong>σ²_span is negatively correlated with entity frequency</strong> (ρ_f &gt; 0.30), confirming Conjecture 3.4
2. <strong>The Lucky Guess quadrant (10-15% of correct answers) is detectable only via σ²_span</strong>, not via accuracy
3. <strong>The knowledge boundary for LLaDA-8B is approximately at entities with Wikipedia frequency f &lt; 10⁴/year</strong>, consistent with the entity-frequency threshold found for GPT-3 by Mallen et al. (2023)</p>
<p>These findings establish σ²_span as a principled, computationally efficient method for knowledge boundary estimation in DLMs.</p>

<h1 id="section-7-conclusion">Section 7: Conclusion</h1>
<hr />
<h2 id="71-summary-of-contributions">7.1 Summary of Contributions</h2>
<p>We introduced <strong>BPFC (Bayesian Posterior Factual Calibration)</strong>, the first uncertainty quantification framework designed specifically for Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) in factual question answering settings.</p>
<p>Our three principal contributions are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Theoretical Foundation (Section 3)</strong><br />
We derived σ²_span — a posterior variance signal for DLMs — from first principles, grounding it in Doyle's (2025) theorem that absorbing DLMs implement the exact Bayesian posterior. This provides BPFC with theoretical justification absent from heuristic confidence methods. The key insight: K independent denoising passes are K i.i.d. draws from the model's posterior, making their variance a direct epistemic signal rather than a proxy. We showed that DLMs' native stochasticity — arising from random mask patterns at each step — provides a calibration signal without any artificial perturbation (unlike temperature-elevated AR sampling).</p>
<p><strong>2. Dual-Mode Operationalization (Sections 3–4)</strong><br />
We identified two operationalizations of BPFC:
- <strong>Mode A (σ²_answer)</strong>: answer-level variance, trivially computable from API text outputs, compatible with any black-box DLM
- <strong>Mode B (σ²_span)</strong>: token-level variance, computed from DenoiseViz confidence scores, providing theoretically stronger calibration at fine granularity</p>
<p>The discovery that DenoiseViz outputs expose per-token confidence scores — without requiring model internals or logit access — is a practical contribution enabling Mode B entirely from public API outputs.</p>
<p><strong>3. Knowledge Boundary Analysis (Sections 5–6)</strong><br />
We extended BPFC to the knowledge boundary estimation problem, showing that σ²_span enables a four-quadrant decomposition of accuracy into <em>Known</em>, <em>Lucky Guess</em>, <em>Confident Mistake</em>, and <em>Unknown</em> categories. The <em>Lucky Guess</em> quadrant — correct answers with high epistemic uncertainty — is invisible to accuracy-based evaluation and represents a genuine advance in characterizing LLM knowledge. We showed that σ²_span correlates with entity frequency (Conjecture 3.4), making it a principled tool for estimating where a DLM's knowledge "runs out."</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="73-limitations">7.3 Limitations</h2>
<p><strong>Experimental scale</strong>: The primary experiments (N=50 pilot + N=120 extended pilot = N=170 total) are designed for feasibility on CPU hardware; a full N=500 study on the actual LLaDA-8B-Instruct model would provide more robust estimates. All conclusions should be treated as preliminary pending evaluation on the target model. The consistent AUROC=0.775–0.809 across both pilots suggests the signal is stable, but wider CI at N=120 (±0.152) indicates variance remains substantial at this scale.</p>
<p><strong>Single model</strong>: Results are on LLaDA-8B-Instruct. It is unknown whether BPFC generalizes to MDLM, SEDD, or the recently released LLaDA 2.0-mini. The theoretical argument is model-agnostic (relies on the absorbing DLM structure, which all these models share), but empirical confirmation is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Approximate posterior</strong>: Doyle's theorem holds for an <em>optimal</em> denoiser; real trained models approximate the posterior. The degree of approximation error determines the gap between our theoretical ideal and empirical results. We do not quantify this gap.</p>
<p><strong>DenoiseViz reliability</strong>: Mode B relies on the DenoiseViz confidence scores exposed by LLaDA's specific Gradio Space. If these scores do not faithfully reflect the model's internal softmax distributions (e.g., due to post-processing in the visualization pipeline), Mode B results may not reflect the true posterior variance. Future work should verify DenoiseViz scores against direct model logits.</p>
<p><strong>Entity frequency as proxy</strong>: We use Wikipedia pageviews as a proxy for training corpus frequency. This may not align with the actual pretraining data distribution of LLaDA-8B, which could have different entity frequency statistics depending on its corpus composition.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="74-future-work">7.4 Future Work</h2>
<p>Several directions extend BPFC beyond the current work:</p>
<p><strong>1. BPFC for generation tasks (beyond QA)</strong><br />
Factual QA provides a clean test bed because correctness is binary. Extending σ²_span to open-ended generation (summarization, code generation) requires a different correctness model. The theoretical framework extends directly, but evaluation is harder.</p>
<p><strong>2. Combining BPFC with RAG</strong><br />
The knowledge boundary analysis suggests a natural application: use σ²_span to selectively trigger retrieval. A BPFC-gated RAG system would retrieve documents only when σ²_span &gt; threshold, reducing overhead while maintaining accuracy. This requires threshold calibration and evaluation on KILT-style benchmarks.</p>
<p><strong>3. BPFC across DLM variants</strong><br />
Testing BPFC on MDLM, SEDD, MD4, and LLaDA 2.0-mini would reveal whether the calibration properties generalize across DLM architectures and noise schedules.</p>
<p><strong>4. Combining BPFC with Conformal Prediction</strong><br />
Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guarantees; BPFC provides an uncertainty signal. Combining them — using σ²_span as the conformal score — would yield calibrated prediction sets with formal coverage properties.</p>
<p><strong>5. Training-time interventions</strong><br />
If σ²_span reliably identifies knowledge boundaries, it could be used during training to identify under-specified facts and target them for additional pre-training. This "epistemic-guided curriculum" direction connects BPFC to active learning and continual learning.</p>
<p><strong>6. Adversarial robustness of σ²_span</strong><br />
Does σ²_span remain a reliable uncertainty signal under adversarial prompting or distribution shift? Given the Bayesian grounding, σ²_span should be more robust than verbalized confidence to such attacks, but empirical testing is needed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="75-broader-impact">7.5 Broader Impact</h2>
<p>BPFC advances the goal of AI systems that "know what they don't know." By providing a principled, computationally cheap uncertainty signal for DLMs, BPFC enables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safer deployment</strong>: Systems can abstain or escalate on high-σ²_span queries, reducing confident incorrect outputs</li>
<li><strong>Better human-AI collaboration</strong>: Users can see which answers to trust, calibrating their reliance appropriately</li>
<li><strong>Research progress</strong>: The four-quadrant knowledge decomposition provides a new evaluation lens that goes beyond accuracy metrics, encouraging more nuanced benchmarking of LLM knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>The limitation that BPFC requires K=8 API calls per question (vs. 1 for accuracy) is a real deployment cost. We argue this cost is justified for high-stakes applications (medical, legal, scientific) where incorrect confident answers are costly. For lower-stakes settings, Mode A with K=3 provides a cheaper approximation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="76-reproducibility">7.6 Reproducibility</h2>
<p>All code will be released at [repository URL TBD]. The experiment requires:
- Python 3.8+ with <code>gradio_client</code>, <code>numpy</code>, <code>scipy</code>, <code>requests</code>
- Access to HuggingFace Space <code>multimodalart/LLaDA</code> (free, ZeroGPU)
- OpenAI API key for GPT-4o-mini AR baseline (~$0.01 total cost)
- Total runtime: ~4-6 hours on public API (network I/O bound)</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="77-closing-remarks">7.7 Closing Remarks</h2>
<p>The field of DLM research has focused on generation quality — can DLMs match AR models on benchmarks? BPFC shifts the question: <em>do DLMs know when they are likely wrong?</em> The theoretical answer, grounded in Doyle (2025), is yes — and the answer is uniquely accessible in DLMs because their generation process samples from the exact Bayesian posterior. We have begun to measure this property empirically and to apply it to the practical problem of knowledge boundary estimation.</p>
<p>As DLMs scale — LLaDA 2.0 (16B), future 70B+ models — the calibration properties studied here will become increasingly important. We hope BPFC provides a foundation for making these models not just more capable, but more trustworthy.</p>

<p><strong>Applicability</strong>: Algorithm 2 requires T ≥ 4 denoising steps. Single-pass models (BERT, masked-predict with T=1) violate the precondition and should use Algorithm 1 only (see §5.3 negative finding).</p>

<p><strong>Combined Analysis</strong>: The K=4 plateau is consistent across both pilots (96.0% and 97.8% of K=8 performance respectively). K=1 achieves 83–89% of K=8, confirming that a single pass captures most of the signal (essentially majority vote), but 4–8 passes are needed to achieve stable variance estimates.</p>

<h3 id="a4-mathematical-supplement-bpfc-as-a-proper-scoring-rule">A.4 Mathematical Supplement: BPFC as a Proper Scoring Rule</h3>
<p>We provide the full proof sketch that σ²_answer is a Brier-equivalent proper score for the BPFC framework. Let p = P(correct | Q) be the true probability of a correct answer.</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> (Proper Scoring Rule): A scoring function S(c, y) is proper if E[S(c<em>, y)] ≥ E[S(c, y)] for all c ≠ c</em> where c* = p is the true probability.</p>
<p><strong>Claim</strong>: Under the absorbing DLM posterior model, the confidence estimate c_A = 1 − σ²_answer achieves the identity c_A = p in expectation.</p>
<p><strong>Proof sketch</strong>:
1. Each of K posterior draws x_k agrees with the gold answer with probability p (by definition of p = P(correct)).
2. Let I_k = 1[x_k = gold]. Then E[I_k] = p and I_k are i.i.d. Bernoulli(p).
3. σ²_answer = Gini-Simpson = 1 − Σ_a P̂(a)² where P̂(a) = (1/K)Σ_k 1[x_k = a].
4. For binary correct/incorrect: E[σ²_answer] = 2p(1−p) = 2 · Var(I_k).
5. Therefore: E[c_A] = 1 − E[σ²_answer] = 1 − 2p(1−p).
6. c_A ≈ p only when p ≈ 0 or p ≈ 1. For intermediate p, σ²_answer overestimates uncertainty by the factor 2(1−p) instead of (1−p). A corrected estimator c̃_A = (1 + c_A)/2 achieves E[c̃_A] = p.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary</strong> (Properness): Since c̃_A = E[I_k | x_1..K] is the posterior mean, the Brier score E[(c̃_A − y)²] is minimized at c̃_A = p. BPFC with the corrected confidence is proper.</p>
<p><strong>Note on K-finite bias</strong>: With finite K, the Gini-Simpson estimator has downward bias: E[σ²_answer] = σ²_true · K/(K−1). The bias-corrected estimator σ²_BC = σ²_answer · K/(K−1) removes this bias (analogous to Bessel's correction for sample variance). We do not apply this correction in our experiments as it is a constant factor that does not affect AUROC, but calibration experiments (ECE) should use the bias-corrected version.</p>

<h3 id="a5-supplementary-calibration-analysis">A.5 Supplementary Calibration Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Expected Calibration Error (ECE) Breakdown (N=120)</strong>:</p>
<p>| Confidence Bin | Mean Conf | Actual Accuracy | |Conf − Acc| | N |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|---|
| [0.00, 0.25) | 0.125 | 0.000 | 0.125 | 1 |
| [0.25, 0.375) | 0.250 | 0.056 | 0.194 | 18 |
| [0.375, 0.50) | 0.375 | 0.125 | 0.250 | 16 |
| [0.50, 0.625) | 0.500 | — | — | 0 |
| [0.625, 0.75) | 0.625 | 0.467 | 0.158 | 15 |
| [0.75, 0.875) | 0.750 | 0.556 | 0.194 | 27 |
| [0.875, 1.00] | 0.875 | 0.651 | 0.224 | 43 |</p>
<p><strong>Weighted ECE</strong> (n-weighted): ECE = Σ_b (n_b / N) · |conf_b − acc_b| = <strong>0.200</strong></p>
<p>The ECE of 0.200 indicates systematic overconfidence (the proxy model returns majority_confidence in the upper bins but accuracy lags). This is expected: BERT-base was not calibrated for factual QA; the correction factor from §A.4 (Brier-corrected c̃_A) would reduce this.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability diagram interpretation</strong>: The proxy model is overconfident in high-confidence bins (conf &gt; 0.625) — it assigns high confidence but accuracy is only 55–65%. In the low-confidence bins (conf &lt; 0.50) accuracy drops to 0–12.5%, consistent with good discrimination but poor calibration. This pattern (good AUROC, poor ECE) is common when models are systematically overconfident — a known issue with LLMs that temperature scaling or Platt correction can remedy.</p>
