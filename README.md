# 🧠 Diffusion Meta-Cognition Research (Dr. Claw)

> Exploring the intersection of diffusion language models and meta-cognition / mechanistic understanding — finding novel, unexplored research directions.

## Research Questions

- How do diffusion LLMs represent and process knowledge differently from autoregressive models?
- What unique meta-cognitive properties emerge from denoising objectives?
- What are the mechanistic differences in how uncertainty is modeled?
- Which directions are most promising and unexplored?
