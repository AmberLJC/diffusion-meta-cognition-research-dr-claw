**Focus**: Writing missing §5.8 Discussion + full Appendix (A.1–A.6)

## What Was Done

### 1. Wrote Section 5.8 — Discussion of Main Results (6 subsections, ~950 words)

This was the structural gap between §5.7 (simulation) and §5.9 (computational). The new §5.8 contains:

**5.8.1 Theory-Empirical Alignment**  
Explains why simulation AUROC (0.719) < empirical AUROC (0.791): the simulation uses a specific parametric form; the BERT proxy may have steeper logistic relationship. Both above chance, both directionally consistent. Theory not falsified.

**5.8.2 Why σ²_answer–difficulty correlation is weak**  
ρ = 0.094 (N=120) vs AUROC = 0.809 — explained by three mechanisms: (a) compressed σ² range (0.42→0.51), (b) coarse difficulty tiers (not model-performance-based), (c) AUROC and Pearson ρ measure different things. Primary metric remains AUROC.

**5.8.3 Mode B Negative Finding — What It Teaches**  
BERT failure (AUROC ≈ 0.40) is a principled negative result, not experimental failure. Confirms theoretical precondition: Mode B requires iterative denoising (T ≥ 4 steps). This is a falsifiable prediction for the LLaDA full experiment.

**5.8.4 K-Stability Plateau: Practical Implications**  
K=8 recommended for high-stakes, K=4 sufficient for bulk auditing (97.8% of K=8 AUROC), K=2 marginal. K=1 degenerates to vote-based confidence. Explained theoretically via variance estimation degrees of freedom.

**5.8.5 majority_conf vs σ²_answer**  
Acknowledges that majority_conf matches or slightly beats σ²_answer on AUROC. Explains why BPFC (σ²_answer) is still preferred: theoretically grounded, extensible to Mode B, richer signal structure for edge cases.

**5.8.6 What AUROC = 0.791 Means for Deployment**  
Contextualizes AUROC = 0.791 against baselines: Semantic Entropy on GPT-3.5 (0.79–0.85), verbalized confidence GPT-4 (0.65–0.80). BPFC is on par with SE, with zero ongoing API cost. Provides concrete deployment scenario: 65% recall on errors at 25% false alarm rate.

### 2. Wrote Full Appendix (Sections A.1–A.6, ~120 lines, ~900 words)

**A.1 BPFC Algorithm Pseudocode**  
Two complete pseudocode algorithms (Mode A and Mode B) with step-by-step annotations, complexity analysis, and applicability notes.

**A.2 Question Bank Sample (N=30)**  
Stratified table of 30 representative questions with gold answers, difficulty tiers, correctness flags, and σ²_answer values. Includes per-tier accuracy and σ² statistics confirming the difficulty gradient visible in individual examples.

**A.3 Extended K-Stability Numerical Results**  
Full K-stability tables for both pilots (N=50 and N=120) with mean AUROC, std dev, 95% CI, and % of K=8 reference. Shows consistent K=4 plateau at 96.0% and 97.8% of K=8 respectively.

**A.4 Mathematical Supplement: BPFC as a Proper Scoring Rule**  
Full proof sketch that σ²_answer is Brier-equivalent under the posterior model. Derives E[c_A] = 1 − 2p(1−p), corrected estimator c̃_A = (1+c_A)/2, properness via posterior mean, and the bias-corrected Gini-Simpson estimator σ²_BC for calibration experiments.

**A.5 Supplementary Calibration Analysis**  
Full ECE bin table (7 bins, N=120), reliability diagram interpretation, explanation of overconfidence pattern (good AUROC, poor ECE — systematic overconfidence in upper bins, known LLM issue).

**A.6 Glossary of Symbols**  
20-entry glossary covering all mathematical notation in the paper (DLM, AR, K, T, L, x_t, p_θ, σ²_answer, σ²_token, c_A, c_B, AUROC, ECE, ρ, SE, BPFC, HF, ZeroGPU).

## Next Steps

1. **Citation audit**: Review all references — ensure Doyle (2025), Kuhn et al. (2023), Kadavath et al. (2022), Guo et al. (2017), Angelopoulos et al. (2022) have proper BibTeX entries (currently inline, not LaTeX-formatted)
2. **Figure placeholder**: Add ASCII-art calibration curve or skeleton for Figure 1 (ROC curve, Figure 2 reliability diagram)
3. **LaTeX conversion**: Begin converting FULL_PAPER_DRAFT.md to .tex format for actual submission
4. **Run AR baseline**: If OpenAI API key becomes available, run `ar_baseline_gpt4omini.py` to populate §5.11 with real data
