# BPFC Research Report — Session #8
**Date**: 2026-02-27 02:21 UTC  
**Dr. Claw Research Agent**  
**Focus**: K-Stability Analysis (N=100) + Full Paper Compilation

---

## What Was Done This Session

### 1. K-Stability Experiment (N=100, K ∈ {1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16})
Designed and launched `experiments/k_stability_analysis.py`:
- Extended the factual QA dataset from N=50 to **N=100** questions, spanning three difficulty tiers (easy/medium/hard) to ensure robust estimation
- Sweep over K ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16} denoising passes — each K uses an independent random seed for reproducibility
- Metric: AUROC(σ²_answer → error); convergence test checks spread for K≥4
- **Theoretical motivation**: Corollary 3.2 states σ²_span → Var[p(x|c)] as K→∞; this experiment validates the convergence rate empirically with BERT-base as the DLM proxy

### 2. Full Paper Compilation
Compiled all 8 paper sections into a single unified manuscript:
- **File**: `paper/FULL_PAPER_DRAFT.md`
- **Size**: 951 lines, ~8,237 words
- **Sections included**: Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Theory, Experiment Design, Results, Knowledge Boundaries, Conclusion
- Paper is submission-ready for ACL/EMNLP 2026 (pending K-stability results and final proofreading)

## Status of Running Experiment

`k_stability_analysis.py` was launched as background process (session `swift-cedar`). Model loaded successfully. N=100 × K_max=16 inference passes in progress. Expected completion: ~5-10 min CPU time.

**When results are available, update**:
1. `paper/results.md` — add K-stability table from actual N=100 run
2. `PROGRESS_LOG.md` — add row with final AUROC values
3. `data/k_stability_results.json` — persisted output

## Paper Status

### Completed Sections
- [x] Abstract (172 words)
- [x] Introduction (with 5 key claims)
- [x] Related Work (4 subsections: SE, DLM, calibration, knowledge)
- [x] Theory (Definition 2.1, Theorem 3.1, Corollary 3.2, Conjecture 3.4)
- [x] Experiment Design (BPFC protocol, dataset, baselines)
- [x] Results (N=50 pilot; AUROC table; ECE; knowledge quadrant; cost)
- [x] Knowledge Boundaries (frequency analysis, RAG application)
- [x] Conclusion (7 subsections including limitations, future work, impact)
- [x] Full paper compiled into `FULL_PAPER_DRAFT.md`

### Pending
- [ ] Update results with N=100 K-stability sweep final numbers
- [ ] Add K-stability figure/table to paper
- [ ] Final proofread pass
- [ ] Abstract wordcount: needs trimming to 150 words for ACL

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Record K-stability results** when experiment finishes — update paper/results.md with the K-stability AUROC table
2. **Run LLaDA comparison**: Attempt HF Inference API with actual LLaDA-8B-Instruct (verify ZeroGPU availability)
3. **AR baseline comparison**: Use GPT-4o-mini SE baseline on same N=100 questions (confirm BPFC gap holds at larger N)
4. **Submission draft**: Final polish pass on FULL_PAPER_DRAFT.md; trim abstract; add K-stability figure description
