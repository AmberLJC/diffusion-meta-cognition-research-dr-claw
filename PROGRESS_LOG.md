| # | Date (UTC) | Summary |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | 2026-02-27 00:00 | 🚀 Project initialized — scaffolded repo structure, identified 5 candidate research directions around meta-cognition in diffusion LLMs vs autoregressive models. |
| 2 | 2026-02-27 00:11 | 🔬 First deep literature search — discovered "Confusion Zones" in denoising trajectories (arXiv:2511.15208) and confirmed zero existing work on epistemic calibration for diffusion LMs; proposed CZEC as top novel direction. |
| 3 | 2026-02-27 00:41 | 🧪 BPFC pilot experiment written (experiments/bpfc_pilot.py, 500+ lines, dry-run verified); confirmed ALL LLaDA variants return HTTP 410 on HF Inference API; found new adjacent paper arXiv:2602.08920 (clearly differentiated); LLaDA 2.0-mini discovered as superior candidate model; theoretical framing drafted (Bayesian posterior → σ²_answer proxy). |
